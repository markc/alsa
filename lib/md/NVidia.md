NVidia do not produce cound cards but their motherboard chipsets do
provide a PCI bus interface for audio chips mounted on the motherboard.
As a result they can appear to be Nvidia sound cards. See [Sound Cards:
Introduction](/Sound_Cards:_Introduction "Sound Cards: Introduction")
for details.

NVidia use a PCI bus interface which is very similar to that used by
Intel. As a result the NVidia interfaces can be driven with the
[intel8x0](/Intel8x0 "Intel8x0") alsa driver.
