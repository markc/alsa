Recording [MIDI](/MIDI "MIDI") files using [ALSA](/ALSA "ALSA")
---------------------------------------------------------------

There are two ways to record [MIDI](/MIDI "MIDI") files using
[ALSA](/ALSA "ALSA"). For information about playing MIDI files, see the
page [PlayingMidiFiles](/PlayingMidiFiles "PlayingMidiFiles").

### Using [MIDI keyboards](/MIDI_keyboards "MIDI keyboards") connected to your PC

If you have a musical instrument like a MIDI keyboard you can connect it
to your soundcard's [MIDI interface](/MIDI_interface "MIDI interface")
and record a MIDI file from the MIDI port where the MIDI keyboard is
attached while you play some music on the keyboard. You can use MIDI
sequencer software such as [Rosegarden](/Rosegarden "Rosegarden") or
[Muse](/Muse "Muse") to record the MIDI file from the MIDI port.

### Using MIDI sequencer software on your PC

If you have MIDI sequencer software such as
[Rosegarden](/Rosegarden "Rosegarden") or [Muse](/Muse "Muse"), you can
create music on your PC and record it in a MIDI file. These two MIDI
applications also do musical score editing which can be useful for
creating complex music. There is also the *[vkeybd](/Vkeybd "Vkeybd")*
utility which provides a virtual MIDI piano keyboard which you can
record from while you play the virtual piano (either by repeatedly
mouseclicking on the piano notes or by using keyboard shortcuts for the
different notes)
